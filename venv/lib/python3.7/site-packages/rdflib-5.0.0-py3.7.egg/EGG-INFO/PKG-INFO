RDFLib is a Python library for working with
RDF, a simple yet powerful language for representing information.

The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3,
NTriples, Turtle, TriX, RDFa and Microdata . The library presents
a Graph interface which can be backed by any one of a number of
Store implementations. The core rdflib includes store
implementations for in memory storage, persistent storage on top
of the Berkeley DB, and a wrapper for remote SPARQL endpoints.

A SPARQL 1.1 engine is also included.

If you have recently reported a bug marked as fixed, or have a craving for
the very latest, you may want the development version instead:

   pip install git+https://github.com/rdflib/rdflib
