Purpose
========

This package contains the code from importlib as found in Python 2.7. It is
provided so that people who wish to use ``importlib.import_module()`` with a
version of Python prior to 2.7 or in 3.0 have the function readily available.
The code in no way deviates from what can be found in the Python 2.7 standard
library.

For documentation, see the `importlib docs`_ for Python 2.7.

Notice about maintenance
========================

Due to the fact that this project is only applicable to versions of Python that
are no `longer supported <http://cpython-devguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#status-of-python-branches>`_,
there will be no further maintenance of this project. Since the code included
in this project is simply copied from Python 2.7 itself, if you need updated
fixes you can copy the files manually on your own.
